## 2. Basic Git Workflow

Here is a simple workflow for contributing to any project:

1. **Fork** the repository you want to contribute to (creates a copy in your GitHub account).  
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
3. Create a new branch for your work:
   ``` bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
