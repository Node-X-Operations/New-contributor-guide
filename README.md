## 1. Introduction to Git and GitHub

- **Git** is a distributed version control system that helps track changes to files and collaborate on code.  
- **GitHub** is an online platform that hosts Git repositories and makes collaboration easier through issues, pull requests, and code reviews.

2. Basic Git Workflow

Here is a simple workflow for contributing to any project:

1. Fork the repository you want to contribute to (creates a copy in your GitHub account).

2. Clone your fork to your local machine:  
    git clone

3. Create a new branch for your work:  
    git checkout \-b feature-name

4. Make your changes in the code.

5. Commit your changes with a meaningful message:  
    git add .  
    git commit \-m "Add feature description"

6. Push the branch to your forked repo:  
    git push origin feature-name

7. Open a Pull Request on the original repository to propose your changes.

8. Collaborate through comments and make any requested updates.

3. Creating and Managing Branches

Branches allow you to work on features or bug fixes independently without affecting the main codebase.

* Create a branch:  
   git checkout \-b branch-name

* Switch branches:  
   git checkout branch-name

* Delete a branch locally:  
   git branch \-d branch-name

---

4. Making and Sharing Changes

* Stage your changes:  
   git add (or use '.' to add all changes)

* Commit changes with a clear message:  
   git commit \-m "Describe what you changed"

* Push changes to GitHub:  
   git push origin branch-name

---

5. Collaborating with Others

* Use Issues to report bugs or suggest features.

* Review and comment on Pull Requests.

* Sync your fork with the upstream repository:  
   git remote add upstream  
   git fetch upstream  
   git checkout main  
   git merge upstream/main  
   git push origin main
